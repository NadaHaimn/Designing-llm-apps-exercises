# 🚀 Designing Large Language Model Applications – Exercises

This repository contains my personal exercises, notes, and experiments based on the book **"Designing Large Language Model Applications"** by Andrej Karpathy & OpenAI.  
The book focuses on how to use LLMs like GPT-4 to build real-world applications efficiently and responsibly.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

Each notebook explores a key concept from the book with hands-on code, explanations, and observations:

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `01_prompt_engineering.ipynb` | Prompt Engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) |
| `02_rag.ipynb` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector search |
| `03_tools.ipynb` | Using tools with LLMs (e.g., calculators, search, custom APIs) |
| `04_agents.ipynb` | Building agent-based workflows using tools and memory |
| `05_evaluation.ipynb` | How to evaluate LLM outputs effectively |
| `06_final_project_agent_app.ipynb` | A full working agent app integrating all the above |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- 🧠 OpenAI GPT-4 API  
- 🐍 Python (Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab)  
- 🧱 LangChain (optional)  
- 🔍 FAISS / Chroma for vector search (in RAG)  
- 📦 Other libraries: `requests`, `dotenv`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` (if needed)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook you want to explore via **Google Colab** or Jupyter.
2. Insert your OpenAI API Key (recommended via `.env` or Colab cell).
3. Run each cell step-by-step and review the outputs.
4. Modify prompts and logic to explore your own ideas.

> ⚠️ Important: Always keep your API key private and never share notebooks with your key visible.
